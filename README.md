# Mid Sussex Swim

This application is designed to display swimming sessions from [Mid Sussex District Council's leisure centres](https://www.midsussex.gov.uk/leisure-sport/leisure-centres-and-conferencing/) in a more mobile-friendly HTML interface. The leisure centres are managed by [Places Leisure](https://www.placesleisure.org/), and the management software appears to be [Leisure Hub by Xn Leisure](https://www.xnleisure.com/what-we-do/self-service-solutions/leisure-hub--joining-and-bookings). The code may be useful for other leisure centres using similar management software.
